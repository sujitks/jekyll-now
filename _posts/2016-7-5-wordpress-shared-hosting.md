title: Wordpress blog on shared hosting
---

I am sure many people loves wordpress and it is really really great blogging platform. Well this is more than the blogging platform as there are many professional websites running on the WordPress.

However I personally found this a bit tricky for me to customise or troubleshoot if things go wrong. My shared hosting provider is not too great and I have stopped bothering for any help or support from them (it is 1 and 1 by the way). Now I have started thinking about moving my blog to different platform and potentially in cloud.

Most probabily new platform would be python or nodejs.

Any thoughts about django or mezzanine would be highly appreciated.

Cheers, Sujit
